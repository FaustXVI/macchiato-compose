# Macchiato compose [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vdemeester/silver-lamp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vdemeester/silver-lamp)

A java library for Docker Compose. It does everything the command-line tool does,
but from within Java â€“ read composes files, start them, scale them, etc..

**Note: This is experimental and is intended to be used to easily integrate compose
workflows with java tools and testing libraries.**
